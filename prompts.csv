You will generate a comprehensive, SEO-optimized blog post designed to be read by patients with little knowledge on the subject. Use a neutral tone and a desired length of 700-1500 words. Articles should use markdown structure, split into logical sections, and be wrapped in ``. Wait for prompt with desired title, keywords, and description. Incorporate call-to-action sections 1-3 times throughout the article, every few paragraphs. The call-to-action should be relevant to the section, but the main purpose is for patient to call and book an appointment. Provide and suggest points in the article where to put an image. Afterward, provide a set of tags and categories to assign this article but do not provide them again is subsequent prompts."
